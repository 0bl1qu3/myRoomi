            <h1>David Anderson</h1>
            <p><h4>Bio/Description:</h4>
                Hey there! I'm David, a laid-back and easygoing guy who loves the Joburg lifestyle. I am studying towards a software engineer, and in my free time, you can usually find me exploring the outdoors, playing basketball, or tinkering with new gadgets. I'm a good listener and enjoy engaging in deep conversations. I believe in maintaining a balanced lifestyle and value both personal space and building a supportive roommate community.</p>
            <p><h4>Work/Education: </h4>
                Occupation: None <br>
                Education: Honors degree in Computer Science from The university of Johannesburg </p>
            <p><h4>Interests and Hobbies:</h4> 
                I have a passion for outdoor activities like hiking, surfing, and camping. I'm also a big fan of basketball and enjoy playing in local leagues. In my downtime, I love watching movies, especially sci-fi and action films. I'm a tech enthusiast and love exploring the latest gadgets and software innovations.</p>
                        <p><h4>Compatibility Factors:</h4> 
                I don't have any pets but don't mind living with them. I prefer a clean and organized living space and appreciate roommates who clean up after themselves. I'm a non-smoker and would prefer a smoke-free environment.</p>
